#Code ->
1 compile  
2 code execute


#Compilation Phase ->
1 Tokenize / lexical
2 Parsing -> AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
3 Code Generation -> Executable code generated from


#why Compilation

#example ->
console.log(this);
console.log(window);
console.log(firstName);
var firstName = "Abdul";

#ECMAScript Documention->
1 Early Error Checking
2 Determining appropiate scope for variable
  -a) Global scope -> firstName


#Code Execute Phase ->  
- In javascript code executes inside execution context
  1- Global Execution context -> Stack
   a) Creation Phase --> window : {} | firstName : undefined | this : window(globle object) | Globale Memory
   b) Code Execution pase --> execute line by line

#JavaScript -> synchronous programming language | Single Thread


#Hoisting 
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use a variable or a function before it's declared in your code.
